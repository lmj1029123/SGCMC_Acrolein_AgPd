* ML Model

The codes used to train the machine learning models are in the ML_Models directory.

slab_train.py and bulk_train.py are used to train the models for AgPd bulk and AgPd slab. They are essentially the same code but with different training dataset.

adsroption_model.py is used to generate the model for adsortpion energy.

* SGCMC

The codes for running the semi-grand canonical Monte-Carlo simulation are in the SGCMC directory. 

MC_bulk.py is used to do MC simulation on the AgPd bulk to obtain the \Delta chemical potential.

MC_slab.py is used to do MC simulation on the AgPd slab to study the surface segregation under vacuum.

MC_Motiff.py is used to do MC simulation on the AgPd slab with acrolein.

For all these three scripts we do 

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
python MC_{*}.py "random seed" "initial number of Pd" "\Delta chemical potential" "T" "model seed" 
#+END_SRC


* Plotting

The scripts used to generate the plots in the paper are in the Plotting directory.
